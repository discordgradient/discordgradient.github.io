                    When you use our bot, Gradient (the "Bot" or the "Service"), we appreciate that you are trusting us with your information. We take your privacy
                    very seriously. In this Privacy Policy, we seek to explain to you in the clearest way possible what information we

                    carefully, as it is important. If there are any terms in this Privacy Policy that you do not agree with, please
                    discontinue use of the Service immediately.

                    <p class="policy-details">In short: We use your information to operate and improve the Service, including to provide support and respond to your requests. We

                    <p class="policy-details">In short: We do not sell or share your personal information with third parties. However, we may disclose your information in
                    response to legal process or a request from a law enforcement agency or regulatory authority.</p>
                    <p class="policy-details">However, since most data collected, stored, and used by the Bot is publicly available to all users who share a mutual
                    server with you (eg. usernames/IDs), we cannot control, and we do not assume any responsibility for, the sharing of any
                    of said publicly available data through the Discord platform.</p>
                    <p class="policy-details">In addition, we cannot control, and we do not assume any responsibility for, information that may be separately
                    collected by third party service providers. The information collected by third parties is different from the information
                    collected by the Service, and we do not have access to nor control over most of this information. It is strongly advised
                    to read Section 14 of this Privacy Policy for more details regarding the data collection practices of third parties, as
                    well as for instructions on how to opt out of applicable data-collecting third parties. If there are any terms in the
                    data collection policies of these third parties that you do not agree with, please discontinue use of our Services
                    immediately.</p>

                    <p class="policy-details">In short: We retain your information for as long as necessary to provide Gradient's services or as required by law. We will
                    delete your information upon your request or when it is no longer needed.</p>
                    <p class="policy-details">We will never store your real name, date of birth, gender, race, and location, unless you voluntarily provide us with

                    <p class="policy-details">When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your information, we will either delete or anonymize such
                    information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your information has been stored in backup archives),
                    then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

                    <p class="policy-details">In short: We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. However,
                    no security measure is perfect, and we cannot guarantee the security of your information.</p>
                    <p class="policy-details">We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any
                    information that we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic
                    transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot
                    promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our
                    security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect
                    your information, transmission of personal information to and from the Bot via the Discord software is at your own risk. You
                    should only access the Bot, and subsequently the Discord software, within a secure environment.</p>

                    of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have

                    any time. Please note, however, that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal, nor will
                    it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than
                    consent.</p>
